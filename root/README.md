# Snippets megawad

This is a bunch of my test, learning and practice maps, tidied up and added to a PK3 megawad.

Each snippet map has been named, tweaked with player start/exit, textured, populated with enought monsters and glaring bugs removed (though several were specifically FOR bug testing). Some have the same geometry as the original maps, but most have been embellished with playable areas and secrets etc.

Please see below for details of each map, and what it was originally intended to test.

You can finds all the [original maps](https://github.com/smeghammer/snippets) on my github site. 

## Map 1 'Just a basic starting map...'

Nothing special about this. A very early simple test of how to build a map, and probably practicing with my map of choice, [Eureka](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Eureka). I added a walkway with some zombie men; and an exit at the bottom of the trench.

## Map 2 'The Imp Cage'

More basics learning. This was about triggering doors from a remote switch, so nothing special. I think it was based on one of the REALLY basic square rooms I originally made (snippets/grate/grate.wad).

## Map 3 'DOOM Patrol'

Now, this one was about using patrol points to get a monster to follow a path. Not entirely sure how successful it is because they will break out of their path as soon as they see you. It was used in my [Corporate Nigjhtmare](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/a-c/corp-nm) map to get some chaingunners to roam along corridors.

## Map 4 'Your best friend is your Enemy!'

[SPOILER ALERT!] Another map based on one of the really basic square test rooms. This one was all about gettint MONSTERS to trigger things. I must admit that I changed this quite a bit. The idea is that the exit CANNOT be opened by you, you must let the zombiemen cross the trigger line enough times to lower the exit platform. (snippets/test.wad)

## Map 5 'The Spider in the Mist'

This was based on a couple of test maps for translucent 3D sectors. Used for liquid and for fog. This map combines both.

## Map 6 'The Baron Swamp'

Somewhat embellished map based on an early attempt at a 3D floor. This one tried to make an underground lair (not very well, you will see the trees attempting to block your view of the visual artefacts...). The barons and the swampy bit are just to make the level a bit more fun.

## Map 7 'The Little Red Room'

Again, based on a basic square test room. This is more of a puzzle, particularly for the secret. Essentially it was playing with linedef trigger/wait times and moving to the triggered platform in a timely fashion.

## Map 8 'Don't Wake the Spectres!'

Another one based on a basic square room. This time however, it has a map ACS script that does two things:

 - Activetes the dormant spectres
 - Toggles light levels in various sectors (simulates switching the lights on and off)

## Map 9 'Footsteps in the Night'

I made a test map with footstep sounds on different floor surfaces (marble, wood, water, fleshy). I embellished it somewhat and turned it into a full-fledged map... 

## Map 10 'Imp Gauntlet'

Based on an early test of 'floating' 3D floors. Retextured a bit, and added a bunch of imps and a teleporter out of the pit.

## Map 11 'BOIIIINGGG!'

A very silly map based on a test map for different activation trigger types (shoot, switch, cross and push). The triggers all use ThrustThingZ and for the rework, ThrustThing as well, so the jumping pinkies can get out of the cage, You'll see... Also uses a thing count to trigger on all dead. Based on snippets/activation_source/activ_src.wad.

## Map 12: The Back Room

This was originally a test of vertical switches in the same position, triggering upper and lower doors. I cheated a bit as it is actually different linedefs. The target doors are managed by control sectors. The actual 'back room' is just a hidden (sort of) area to embellish the map a bit.

## Map 13: Skulls! Faaaazands of 'em!
Another embellished early test of a 3D bridge. I added some decorations from R667 (sparks) and a bunch of PEs.

## Map 14: Skeletons behind the walls
A REALLY old map base. I added a red arachno area for shits and giggles

## Map 15: The Baron of the Furnace
Originally made to showcase some custom textures I made. I added some cyberimps and a Bruiser Demon from R667, as well as a bit of fun with fire.
