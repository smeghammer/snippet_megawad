Idea Base: A Doom style Robot

Description:

A faceless, robotic nightmare. This titanium terror will cut you down with a high velocity chaingun, but watch out for the 
hidden grenade launcher popping out and lobbing 3 grenades your way. Since it is a machine, it feels no pain therefore trying
to outgun it and interupt its relentless fire is pointless.
